""" This project is about creating 7 continental region meteorites table via SQLite3 in Python.
    Compare the geolocation bounding box with data entries which are reclat(latitude) and reclong(longitude).
    There are the geolocation bounding boxs e.g. Region Name: (minimum long, minimum lat, maximum long, maximum lat):
	Africa/Middle East Region: (-17.8, -35.2, 62.2, 37.6)
	Europe Region: (-24.1, 36, 32, 71.1)
	Upper Asia Region: (32.2, 35.8, 190.4, 72.7)
	Lower Asia Region: (58.2, -9.9, 154, 38.6)
	Australia Region: (112.9, -43.8, 154.3, -11.1) 
	North America Region: (-168.2, 12.8, -52, 71.5)
	South America Region: (-81.2, -55.8, -34.4, 12.6) """

How to run this program? Just clone this Repository and open the main.py file on any IDE. Run the main.py and you can create 7 Region Meteorites table on your data base.
